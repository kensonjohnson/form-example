# React Form Example

This is a super simple example of creating a floating label in a form input using css modules in React.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kensonjohnson/form-example && cd form-example
```

2. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the project in development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173/` or press `o + enter` in the terminal.

## Usage

Once you navigate to the page, you will see a simple form with a single input for an email.
When you click into that input, the label will float above the input.
All of the styles are in the `Form.module.css` file and are commented to explain what they do.
The `Form.tsx` file is where the form is created and the `Form.module.css` file is imported to apply the styles.
